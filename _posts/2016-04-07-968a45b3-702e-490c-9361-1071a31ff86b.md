* SYNTHESIZER PROGRAMMING

Michael Bradford has had a long career in programming and sound design. Long before the current vogue, Michael has been involved in synthesizer development, programming & sound design and electronic composition since the 1980s, including a 20-plus year association with legendary composer and arranger Paul Buckmaster (12 Monkeys).

An advocate of analog synths, Michael Bradford maintains close relationships with Moog Music, as well as Korg, Clavia and many others. Michael's modular synth world includes a hybrid of Eurorack and MU synths.
